[Why I’m Breaking Up With the Apple Watch](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/11/fashion/why-im-breaking-up-with-the-apple-watch.html)
>I returned my Apple Watch on Day 3. For me, it is barely useful.  The most useful part is Apple Watch can let me make iPhone in silent mode. But it requires me try to redefine every app again, that is really painful. I want a feature is have chance ignore them by single touch instead of going through every settings. Fitness, i still trust Fitbit. Working with smart home/hotel? It is still for fun right now, i can't even try once in one month. Yeah, i am not the target for Apple Watch too..
